## About the game

I wanted this game to somewhat simulate what a ladybug might go through in real life. You start the game off as a ladybug in a park. There are people walking about and trash scattered on the walkway such as newspapers, paper balls, and banana peels.

## Objective

The objective of the game is to reach the water while dodging any obstacles that may be in the way; this includes: the people walking, rocks, newspapers, paper balls, and banana peels. Once you reach the water your level increases.
